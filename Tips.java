/*

Make sure you understand the question before you begin coding

Check for correctness: refactor, check for edge cases, use variables to clean up your code
Loop in your interviewer to see if they have any questions before cleaning up your code

Optimal solutions: your first solution will not likely be the most optimal; talk through naive solutions and see if you can come up with a reasonably efficient one

Think of your interview as a discussion rather than a test; your interviewer is interested in understanding your thought process

Leave time for testing. Test an Example Input; What edge cases would you test? Update code to handle boundary conditions you missed
